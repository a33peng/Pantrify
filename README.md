# Pantrify

Pantrify is an intelligent recipe and kitchen management app designed to streamline the cooking experience by helping users make the most of the ingredients they already have. Currently in development, Pantrify enables users to input available items from their pantry or fridge and instantly receive tailored recipe suggestions. By focusing on whatâ€™s already at home, the app promotes efficient meal planning, reduces food waste, and enhances everyday convenience. In addition to recipe generation, Pantrify is set to include an integrated AI-powered chatbot assistant and feature a grocery store locator.
